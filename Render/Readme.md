I first created a block and used extrusion to shape it into the approximate shape of a car, then give it a Subdivision Modifier.</br>

Adjust the shape, delete half of vertices, and then add a mirror Modifier, then apply the Subdivision Modifier</br>

Made some detailed characterizations, using surface extrusions and ring cuts</br>

Borrow some shapes by separating some edges and surfaces to make car windows, front bumper, license plate.</br>
Then solidify the text and add a little thickness</br>

I use the cylinder RX to rotate 90 degrees, use I and E, cut out and extrude the approximate shape, Ctrl+B to refine, then use the mirror modifier, and shiftD to copy the other tires, because I want to animate the car shaking , so the tires are separated from the body.</br>

Add materials to each object, add some metalness, add some Clearcoat values to the body, and assign new materials to some connected surfacesï¼Œand gave the Car bulb a yellow self_illuminating</br>

I used a cube, subdivided it, used extrude cuts to make the exit windows and roof, and gave it a smooth modifier at the end,then assign some different materials to different surfaces</br>

I first created a cylinder, elongated it, made some circular cuts with Ctrl+R, made the shape by adjusting the segments, then gave the pole a darker grey, added some metalness, and gave the bulb Part of a self-illuminating render.

I first created an 8-sided cylinder, first reduced the top surface, Ctrl+R to create some segments, made the shape of a pine tree by adjusting the segments and vertices, and finally used another column The body makes the shape of the trunk, Ctrl+T combines them into one entity. Simply tweaked some shapes using the warp spheres to act as bushes. Created a simple fence by extruding the surface of the block. Give them a little more simple material and reduce the specular value a bit</br>
